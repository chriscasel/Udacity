      <b>HTML</b> - Hyper Text Markup Language
      <br>
      <b>Element</b> - Encompasses an input into an HTML Document          <br>
      <b>Void Tag</b> - A certain type of tag that does not need a closing tag
      <br>
      <b>Inline</b> - Uses tags like "br" and "strong" to wrap text
      <br>
      <b>Block</b> - Uses tags like "p" and "form" to separate text into a box with an adjustable height and width.

          The Internet makes requests through servers through <b>HTTP</b>, requesting files from servers. <b>Servers</b> are like computers, but are optimized for storing data and sitting in a dark room.

            HTML documents are made up of text content, markup and references to other documents
            <p>
              An HTML Document is divided into a "Heading" and a "Body" section. CSS and JS elements are inserted into the "Heading" section.

                  Front end development is easy to gain immmediate feedback becuse the repsonse is visual and immediate.
                  <br> Websites are like a house; HTML is the structure, CSS is your choice of decorations an JavaScript is the interactive portion.
                  <br> Google Chrome has a great web developer tool that allows you to read the structure of a website in a tree-like form as Chrome reads it.
                  <br> All text in this developer tool is readable if you explore deep enough. All structure is rectangular.
                  <br> Thinking of each website element as a box will allow the developer to easily arrange things using the "div" tag.
                  <br> HTML is considered tree-like. Basically, this means that HTML is "nested" within itself. This allows the programemr to keep track of the path of each node starting from the root.

                  Learning to program is like building a house. You need to know how to design the house and use tools to build it.
                  <br> You can also put your style code in a "style" tag
                  <br> In CSS a selector defines what particular elements of the page a stlye will apply to
                  <br>The font-syle property can be used to italicize text
                  <br>The font-weight property can be used to make the text more bold
                  <br>In CSS, "/*" and "*/" enters a code comment

                  <h2> Document Object Model</h2>
                  <br> When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The HTML DOM model is construdted as a tree of objects. 
                  <br> The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
                  <br> - The HTML elements as objects
                  <br> - The Properties of all HTML elements
                  <br> - The Methods to access all HTML elements
                  <br> - The events for all HTML elements
                  <br> <i> In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add or delete HTML elements</i>

                    <h2> Importance of Avoding Repetition
                    </h2>
                    It is important for a programmer to not repeat themselves. This is a way for elements that are logicially related to all change predictably and uniformly and thus are kept in sync.

                      <h2>Box Positioning Reminders:
                      </h2>
                      Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline) so by default they take up the enture width of the page. By adding the "Display: flex;" rule to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let Divs appear next to each other.

                        1. Look for Natural Boxes
                        <br> 2. Look for repeated styles & symantic elements
